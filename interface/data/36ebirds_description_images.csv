0,Alpine Leaf Warbler,Phylloscopus affinis,y00989,华西柳莺,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/150272441/1800,"Brown-and-yellow leaf warbler without a wingbar. Breeds in high-altitude areas, in open areas with low vegetation. Winters at lower elevations, including throughout the Indian Subcontinent south of the Himalayas, where it is most abundant in shrubbery in the northeast Indian plains and in the high Western Ghats. Resembles Sulphur-bellied Warbler, but has a yellower cheek and underparts, and shows little contrast between the eyebrow and the throat. Tickell’s spends less time on or near the ground than Sulphur-bellied, tends to flock, and often participates in mixed-species foraging flocks."
1,Arctic Warbler,Phylloscopus borealis,arcwar1,极北柳莺,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/305784291/1800,"Dull, relatively unmarked olive-brown warbler with a prominent yellowish-white eyestripe, faint wingbars, and pale whitish underparts. Visually inseparable from Japanese and Kamchatka Leaf Warblers; listen for song, an electric chattery trill. Also gives a metallic two-noted call and a short harsh buzz. Breeds in shrubby areas, often near water, throughout the Eurasian taiga. Breeding range extends to Alaska, where it is the only leaf warbler. Winters in lowland and foothill forest, forest edge, and gardens, primarily in Southeast Asia."
2,Asian Koel,Eudynamys scolopaceus,asikoe2,噪鹃,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/126392811/1800,"A large cuckoo, distinctive in all plumages, but usually secretive, keeping to the interior of dense trees in many habitats, even inner cities and fields. Adult males glossy black with dull lime-green bill; females and immatures blackish brown with white dots on the wings and strong streaking on head and throat. Adults have ruby-red eyes. Females lay eggs in the nests of other large birds, including crows, shrikes, and starlings. Song is a loud, persistent “ko-EL!” similar to a peacock’s call."
3,Asian Stubtail,Urosphena squameiceps,asistu1,鳞头树莺,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/158510261/1800,"A well-named tiny songbird, “a head with wings,” with rather long bill, long legs, and very short tail. Long buffy supercilium is conspicuous even in the gloomy leaf litter and dense shrubbery where this minute bird lurks. Other brown, skulking warblers such as Dusky and Radde's have much longer tails and lack the strongly contrasting buffy supercilium. Song an insect-like, throbbing buzz recalling a katydid or cicada."
4,Azure-winged Magpie,Cyanopica cyanus,azwmag2,灰喜鹊,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/158510451/1800,"A sleek, long-tailed crow relative--social, highly vocal, and conspicuous in parks, gardens, orchards, riparian areas, and forests. All plumages unmistakable, with black crown, brown back, pale gray belly, and powder-blue wings and tail. Gives raucous, screeching calls as it moves about and is often heard before it is seen."
5,Bianchi's Warbler,Phylloscopus valentini,biawar1,比氏鹟莺,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/180122161/1800,"One of a number of mind-numbingly similar Seicercus warblers. Greenish-yellow above and bright yellow below, with a faint wingbar, a yellow eyering, and a grayish crown marked by two black stripes. Gray of the crown is weaker than that of White-spectacled and Plain-tailed Warblers, but this feature is difficult to see in the shade of the understory, where it usually forages. Breeds in submontane and montane forest up to the treeline; averages higher Martens’s Warbler. Descends into submontane and hill forest in the non-breeding season. Song is an unremarkable but lively burst of whistled notes, lower in pitch than that of Plain-tailed Warbler."
6,Black Bulbul,Hypsipetes leucocephalus,blabul1,黑短脚鹎,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/158511121/1800,"Medium-sized songbird with predominantly dark plumage, a very short crest, and crimson bill and legs. Long tail and bill impart an elongated appearance. Head color varies considerably across distribution, ranging from white to dark gray to black. Often travels in large flocks, which move noisily between fruiting trees. Most commonly found in broadleaf evergreen and mixed deciduous forests but also regularly visits gardens and lowland forests. Extremely noisy, with a huge repertoire, emitting various squeaks, meows, chatters, whistles, and more."
7,Black-browed Reed Warbler,Acrocephalus bistrigiceps,bbrwar1,黑眉苇莺,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/158514971/1800,"Dull brown reed warbler with a sharply marked head, found in a variety of wetland habitats with substantial vegetation cover. Namesake black brow line is not always apparent, but the thick and strikingly pale supercilium is distinctive in its clean-cut and squared-off appearance. Somewhat similar to the rarer Streaked Reed Warbler, but averages much darker and lacks the latter's black striping on the back and wings. Song is a scrambled set of chatters, chirps, and rattles, more musical and tuneful than Oriental Reed Warbler. Gives dry “chit,” often in series."
8,Black-faced Bunting,Emberiza spodocephala,bkfbun1,灰头鹀,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/537891461/1800,"A small songbird that often skulks deep in shrubbery but emerges to forage in the open more than some buntings. Adult male has grayish head and chest, yellow belly, and chestnut back and wings. Female is drab brown and extensively streaked overall. Female is somewhat similar to Gray or Masked buntings but has a paler base to the streaked underparts. Song consists of a variable series of alternating buzzy and warbled notes. A sharp “dink” call often betrays its presence."
9,Black-streaked Scimitar Babbler,Erythrogenys gravivox,bksscb1,斑胸钩嘴鹛,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/180156711/1800,"A large, dark scimitar-babbler. Brown upperparts and white underparts separated by an orangish stripe running along either side of the bird from the face down to the vent. Lightly backswept mustache and a jagged band across the breast are made of the eponymous black streaks. Found in forest, edge, weedy fields, and gardens. Like many other scimitar-babblers, has a frequently-used and advanced repertoire of hoots, cackles, and rattles."
10,Black-throated Bushtit,Aegithalos concinnus,blttit2,红头长尾山雀,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/85774861/1800,"Boldly patterned, tiny bird, usually found in groups. Adult gray above, pale below, with yellow eye and black throat and mask separated by white, chestnut-washed flanks. Juvenile has gray rather than orange and lacks black on throat. Significant regional variation in exact facial patterning: Indochinese population birds have a gray crown (bright rufous in other populations) and Himalayan birds have an white oval brow patch. Forages acrobatically in small branches, sometimes hovering at the tips to extract invertebrates. Often difficult to see in dense trees; presence given away by high-pitched contact calls (“tsip”) and thin, rolling trills. Predominantly found in broadleaf and mixed forests in foothills and submontane areas, but can also range into lowlands."
11,Brown Bush Warbler,Locustella luteoventris,brbwar2,棕褐短翅莺,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/179661221/1800,"Shy inhabitant of scrubby areas in the middle to upper reaches of hilly and montane regions. Dark brown with a white throat and grayish belly. Long tail usually held horizontally, seldom cocked up. Rarely ventures out into the open except when singing; even then, it usually sings from partial cover. Song is a rattling series of dry, repeated notes, somewhat like clattering machinery."
12,Brown-flanked Bush Warbler,Horornis fortipes,bfbwar1,强脚树莺,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/85769061/1800,"Small brown warbler of middle elevations, usually retiring and seldom venturing far from the bushes and short trees from which it gives its distinctive song. Rich, dark brown above and paler gray-brown below, with tawny-brown flanks and pale supercilium. Song a resonant, long whistle followed by a short burst of sharp, bright notes, similar to songs of much larger Manchurian and Japanese Bush Warblers but the whistle is much longer and the following notes not as soft and mellow. Endemic Taiwan subspecies (robustipes) sometimes considered species, called Strong-footed Bush Warbler."
13,Buff-barred Warbler,Phylloscopus pulcher,bubwar1,橙斑翅柳莺,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/169832411/1800,"Small and active “Pallas’s-type” leaf warbler with a long yellow brow stripe and pale rump. Yellowish-olive overall with two tan wingbars, one much larger than the other. White outer tail feathers typically invisible when perched, but eye-catching when the bird is hovering or landing. Extremely similar to other “Pallas’s-type” warblers, but combination of orangish wingbars, weak crown stripe, and rather uniform underparts is diagnostic. Pallas’s Leaf Warbler has a brighter crown stripe, a flashier rump patch, and yellow wingbars. Buff-barred’s head can sometimes have a gray wash similar to that of Ashy-throated Warbler, but it lacks that species’ clean white brow stripe. Buff-barred is common in hilly and montane forests, often as part of mixed-species flocks; listen out for its loud “tzeet” notes and shrill buzzy trill of a song."
14,Chestnut Bulbul,Hemixos castanonotus,chebul1,栗背短脚鹎,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/158660431/1800,"Attractive songbird of forested lowlands and foothills, as well as adjacent parks, farms, and gardens. Chestnut-brown above, white below, with blackish crown and wings and gray wash on breast. Usually found in small to medium-sized flocks, occasionally mixing with other species. Song a distinctive series of three notes with the last being a soft, hoarse whistle; calls include chatters and rattles."
15,Chinese Barbet,Psilopogon faber,chibar1,黑眉拟啄木鸟,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/236501631/1800,"A brightly-colored inhabitant of tropical forest canopies. Slow moving and well camouflaged; its loud and far-carrying song, combined with its secrecy, ensure that it is usually heard far more often than seen. If seen well, combination of red-and-yellow throat, blue ear, black crown, and green body distinguish it from any other similarly sized birds in its range. Regularly visits fruiting trees."
16,Chinese Blackbird,Turdus mandarinus,chibla1,乌鸫,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/158661611/1800,"Large dark thrush of open forests, gardens, and farms; one of the more common urban birds throughout much of its extensive range. Frequently seen on lawns and fields away from cover, pulling up worms and other invertebrates. Both sexes dark with orange bills, the male black overall, the female dark brown. Sings beautifully from exposed perches throughout the day, a series of loud melodic notes that varies between individuals. Often gives a shrill shriek or a series of “wuk” notes when alarmed or agitated."
17,Chinese Blue Flycatcher,Cyornis glaucicomans,butfly2,中华仙鹟,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/181341641/1800,"One of a number of confusingly similar blue flycatchers. Male is brilliant blue above with orange throat and breast; note off-white lower belly. His dark orange throat distinguishes him from Blue-throated Blue Flycatcher. Female is drab brown with an orange chest, white belly, and dull rufous tail. Note weak orangish eyering, dull tannish throat, and overall warm brown coloration. Brown flanks in both sexes. Breeds in montane and hilly forest, typically in areas with dense undergrowth; winters at lower altitudes. Musical song is composed of trills and whistles; calls are a hard “tak” or “chek.”"
18,Chinese Leaf Warbler,Phylloscopus yunnanensis,chilew1,云南柳莺,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/179662441/1800,"Small plump leaf warbler. A “Pallas’s-type” leaf warbler: stout, with a pale rump, crown stripe, and prominent brow stripes. Olive-yellow above with a faint gray wash on the nape. Chinese is distinguished from Pallas’s by its paler, more faded-looking brow and crown stripes, less yellow suffusion all over the body, less compact appearance, and less obvious or absent upper wingbar. Extremely similar Gansu Leaf Warbler and Lemon-rumped Warbler can be difficult to separate; note Chinese’s slightly more elongated and less rounded appearance, a lack of a distinct hook under the end of the brow stripe, less contrasting and more yellowish head patterning, and paler yellowish secondaries. Forages actively, often hovering and hopping about at mid-level. Breeds in montane broadleaved deciduous or mixed forest; moves to lower elevations in winter. On average, found at lower altitudes than Lemon-rumped and Gansu. Lengthy song is unique and bizarre, with a twanging, grating quality: “btrichi-btrichi-btrichi.” Call is an explosive “wip!”, often repeated in medium-length series on the breeding grounds."
19,Chinese Nuthatch,Sitta villosa,snbnut1,黑头䴓,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/181023721/1800,"The clean white brow and dark cap of this nuthatch separate it from other nuthatches in its range. Plain gray upperparts and tannish undersides give it a rather soiled and dirty appearance. Inhabits pine forests, sometimes venturing into large parks and gardens with coniferous stands. Gives a variety of calls, including bleating nasal notes, sharper chips, and loud yammering."
20,Chinese White-browed Rosefinch,Carpodacus dubius,cwbros1,白眉朱雀,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/182366341/1800,"Attractive medium-sized rosefinch. Male has a bright pink face and underparts; unlike the male Himalayan White-browed Rosefinch, he lacks the dark line through the eye, and so does not have an “eyebrowed” appearance. Female is streaky brown all over with paler underparts. Breeds in semi-open scrub, forests, and forest edge at around 3000-4800 meters. Winters in scrubby hilly habitat, sometimes at lower altitudes. Forages on the ground in pairs or small flocks. Commonly gives a rapid series of nasal bleats."
21,Claudia's Leaf Warbler,Phylloscopus claudiae,clalew1,冠纹柳莺,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/537886721/1800,"One of the Blyth’s-type warblers, this species regularly flicks its wings one after the other. Usually forages actively high up in the canopy, clambering along branches. Breeds in well-forested areas, but can be found in sparser forest edges in the winter. A large leaf warbler, it has a pale belly, weak wingbars, and a strong brow and crown pattern. Listen for its song, a squeaky and repetitive series of rolling whistled notes.The closely related Hartert’s Leaf Warbler is very similar but averages brighter yellow, especially on the crown stripe. Calls of the two species are very similar—a quick ‘pee-chuh!’—but their breeding ranges do not overlap. Overlaps on wintering grounds with very similar Blyth’s Leaf Warbler, from which it may be impossible to separate at times; note whiter brow stripe (particularly at the back), less yellow underparts, and slightly different voice."
22,Common Cuckoo,Cuculus canorus,comcuc,大杜鹃,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/45125031/1800,"Found in woodland, heathland, farmland with hedges, marshes with scattered bushes. ""COO-koo"" song (like a cuckoo clock) often given from open perch. Note long wings and tail, barred belly, rather small bill. Flight direct and often low, suggesting a hawk or falcon. Extremely similar in appearance to various other Cuculus cuckoos across its range; note the combination of white vent, staring yellow irises, and overall large size. Lays eggs in nests of other birds, particularly pipits and reed warblers, which raise the young cuckoos."
23,Common Kestrel,Falco tinnunculus,eurkes,红隼,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/256164041/1800,"Small falcon with distinctive male plumage: gray head, rusty back, gray tail with broad black tip. Female is brownish above, with barring on the back, wings, and tail. Note rather pointed wingtips (unlike rounded wings of Accipiter hawks), and distinct dark spotting on the breast. Inhabits open and lightly wooded country, farmlands, grasslands, and heathlands; often seen over grassy areas beside roads and at airports. Perches on wires and posts, and typically hunts by hovering, at times fairly high overhead. Very similar to Lesser Kestrel."
24,Common Rosefinch,Carpodacus erythrinus,comros,普通朱雀,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/169288651/1800,"Medium-sized, dumpy finch with a stubby bill. Male are distinctive with a red head, breast, and rump, brown eye-mask, and white belly. The amount of red varies with age. Females and juveniles are a rather unprepossessing, uniform brown inviting confusion with female House Sparrows; note the two pale wingbars. Breeds at both low and high elevations in deciduous scrub, meadows, and marsh edges as well as clearings in forest. Far-carrying, whistled, typically 3-note song is memorable."
25,Daurian Redstart,Phoenicurus auroreus,daured1,北红尾鸲,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/158662921/1800,"Active and attractive songbird of open spaces. Breeds in open forests and scrubby vegetation in subalpine areas; winters in a wider altitudinal range in scrubby forest edges, gardens, and fields. Frequently bobs the orange-sided dark tail. Male sports a gray crown and nape, black face, orange underparts, and dark wings with a white wing patch. Females are brownish overall but share the male's bright tail and wing patch. Compare carefully with Common, Hodgson’s, and Black Redstarts. Song is a lively, jingling cascade of warbling; calls include a short, high-pitched whistle and a hard “tsak.”"
26,Eastern Yellow Wagtail,Motacilla tschutschensis,eaywag,东黄鹡鸰,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/300219251/1800,"Attractive ground-dwelling bird. Slender and long-tailed, bright yellow below with paler throat and grayish-olive back; extremely variable. Tail is black with white outer feathers; often pumps tail up and down while walking on the ground. Young birds lack yellow color, but have distinctive head pattern. Often seen near water. Listen for high-pitched, piercing call note. Common breeder on Arctic tundra from Alaska to Russia; found in grassy and waterside habitats in Southeast Asian wintering grounds and in migration."
27,Japanese Tit,Parus minor,gretit4,远东山雀,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/158864951/1800,"Large and pugnacious, this common tit is found in a wide range of wooded habitats, from dense hill forests to manicured city parks. Found throughout much of East Asia, this species is closely-related to the more brightly-colored Great Tit, from which it was split as a distinct species. Adult has a flashy white cheek on a black head, a black stripe on a white belly, and gray wings with a hint of green near the shoulder. Juveniles are duller, replacing the adult’s black with gray. Very vocal; song is a bright “tzi-hei tzi-hei!”; also gives loud chips, seeps, and harsh “tzi-tzi-tzshhhhhh.”"
28,Light-vented Bulbul,Pycnonotus sinensis,livbul1,白头鹎,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/158684261/1800,"Common songbird of gardens, parks, and forests. Adult dark olive above, white below, with black-and-white head pattern. Hainan subspecies has a blackish head with white limited to ear patch. Juvenile dull brown above (greenish in wings), white below, lacking head pattern. Hybrids with Styan’s Bulbul appear intermediate, with the moustachial stripe and white feathers around the eye of Styan’s but at least partly white nape of Light-vented. Common song is a ringing series of four notes, “wee-wee-der-wee.”"
29,Masked Laughingthrush,Pterorhinus perspicillatus,maslau1,黑脸噪鹛,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/158865411/1800,"A rowdy and sociable inhabitant of gardens, parks, and shrubby thickets, this long-tailed, black-eared bird is unmistakable. Upper body is dark gray overall, with brown primarily on the belly but also with some in the wings. Vent area is a dirty rufous color, often seen as the bird intermittently pumps its tail while foraging. Bold, often foraging out in the open on lawns and field edges, but even when hidden, its harsh chattering will give it away."
30,Olive-backed Pipit,Anthus hodgsoni,olbpip,树鹨,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/140329191/1800,"Small pipit with a greenish-brown back and heavily streaked breast and belly that is often seen in loose flocks or in pairs. Note the distinctive facial pattern: broad pale lines surrounding the eye and a dark ear patch. Prefers more forested areas than other pipits, though will also forage in fields and scrubby edges. Can be tolerant of human activity and is not uncommon in rural areas and city parks in parts of their range. Calls are high-pitched “tseep’s,” often with a buzzy quality. Song is a beautiful series of warbling trills, whistles, and rattles."
31,Pale Thrush,Turdus pallidus,palthr1,白腹鸫,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/158861511/1800,"Although not actually pale, this brownish songbird is one of the plainer thrushes in its range. Found in areas of open woodland and scrubland; less tied to extensive forests than other thrushes, particularly in the winter, when it may often be found near reedbeds and in thickets. Sexes similar, both earthen-brown above, paler below, with grayish head, but male has darker ash-gray face, female a dingy white throat. White tail corners obvious in flight."
32,Streak-breasted Scimitar Babbler,Pomatorhinus ruficollis,sbsbab3,棕颈钩嘴鹛,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/158882111/1800,"An adaptable mid-sized scimitar-babbler found in a range of different habitats, including forests, scrubland, and parks. A bright banana-yellow bill, rusty neck patch, and warm brown wings and tail contrast sharply with a thick inky-black stripe through the eye and bright white brow and throat. Typically travels in flocks, giving loud hoots and slurred call notes while rustling about at mid and lower levels."
33,Swinhoe's White-eye,Zosterops simplex,swiwhe1,暗绿绣眼鸟,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/203280851/1800,"A small yellow-olive warbler-like bird with a prominent white eyering. Occurs in forests, shrublands, parks, gardens, farmlands, and urban areas, where it actively forages for fruit, insects, and nectar from the understory to the top of the forest canopy. Song and calls are high-pitched twitters. Can be easily confused with other species of white-eye throughout its wide range, especially Indian White-eye; note contrast of lemon-yellow throat and more olive-suffused upperparts."
34,White Wagtail,Motacilla alba,whiwag,白鹡鸰,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/44586821/1800,"Distinctive but variable: all plumages are some bold combination of black, white, and gray. Shows considerable variation in plumage across the world, but never has a clear, thin and contrasting eye-brow like White-browed or Japanese Wagtail. Occurs in varied open habitats, from wild grassy areas and wetlands to paved car parks and grassy lawns. Usually seen as singles, pairs, or small groups walking and running around, pumping the long, white-sided tail up and down. Identified easily in flight by its loud, thick and distinctive “tsee-tsee’ call."
35,Yellow-streaked Warbler,Phylloscopus armandii,yeswar1,棕眉柳莺,https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/179662991/1800,"Dull brownish leaf warbler. Brown above with brownish-yellow underparts. Extremely similar in appearance to Radde’s Warbler, but Yellow-streaked has a more contrastingly pale brow stripe, finer bill, and fine yellow streaks on the breast. The breast streaks themselves are often not visible, instead appearing as a faint yellow wash from a distance. Dusky Warbler is somewhat similar but is much browner overall with a darker brow stripe and less contrast between upper- and underparts. Breeds in subalpine shrubbery and descends into foothills to winter in similar habitat. Song is a series of cascading tinkling, buzzy notes. Gives metallic “tinks”."
